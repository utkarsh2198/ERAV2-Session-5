# ERAV2-Session-5
This is School of AI ERA V2 Session - 5 Assignment submission.
This assignment is based on MNIST Digit Classification and aims at teaching us :
- To build our first NNs of this course.
- To get familiar with basics of Pytorch, complete cycle of AI projects and structuring typical AI projects

## Files Overview:

### 1. model.py
The `model.py` file contains the definition of the model architecture using PyTorch. It includes the layers, such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, necessary for the classification task.

### 2. utils.py
The `utils.py` file contains utility functions that are used throughout the project for tasks such as data loading and preprocessing, model training and evaluation, visualization, etc.

### 3. S5.ipynb
`S5.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook file where the main code is written and experiment is conducted. It includes the training loop, model evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Instructions:

To run the code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd ERAV2-Session-5
3. Open `S5.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook:
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new data.

## Additional Notes:

- Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
- The project uses PyTorch for implementing the CNN model.
- For any questions or issues, please contact [Utkarsh Gupta](mailto:utkarsh2198@gmail.com).
